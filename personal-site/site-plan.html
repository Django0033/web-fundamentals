                <strong>Mansions of Madness</strong> If you love stories dealing
                with the Cthulhu Mythos, puzzles, mystery, and a good old
                fashioned dungeon crawling experience, then look no further.
                Mansions of Madness 2nd edition is the game that checkmarks all
                of those boxes. Mansions of Madness 2nd edition is an
                app-assisted board game for one to five players that takes two
                to three hours to complete. This is a unique dungeon crawling,
                horror-mystery experience that focuses on clue acquisition,
                puzzle completion, and sometimes combat against the monsters of
                the mythos.<br />
                <strong>Arkham Horror</strong> Released by Fantasy Flight Games
                in 2016, Arkham Horror: The Card Game replaced the competitive
                Call of Cthulhu LCG with a new, cooperative game. Instead of
                fighting each other, players now team up to tackle the mysteries
                of Arkham over a narrative campaign. Throughout their
                adventures, players will be solving mysteries and leveling up
                their investigators. Once again, this expandable card game
                follows the Fantasy Flight Games LCG model, so players donâ€™t
                have to hunt down rare cards in blind booster packs.<br />
                <strong>Shadow Over Normandie</strong> A few weeks after D-Day,
                a U.S. Ranger Company lost in Normandie has to confront the
                terrifying power of the Nazis' Cult of the Black Sun. Allied
                with an ancient Deep Ones tribe, the Cult of the Black Sun is
                preparing a dark ceremony to summon the great Cthulhu. T Shadows
                over Normandie is a squad/platoon sized game based on the Heroes
                System and is totally compatible with the Heroes of Normandie
                board game. The game features three opposing armies controlled
                by the players. These forces include the German Cult of the
                Black Sun, the ancient Deep Ones, and the U.S. Rangers. Each
                force is made up of infantry, tanks or creatures and of course,
                heroes and villains. Each unit has its own set of unique
                characteristics and skills depicted on the high quality chunky
                tokens.

            <p>
                <strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong><br /><br />

                <strong>What is so fun about board games?</strong> Human beings
                - toddlers, children or adults - like to play by nature. Board
                game is a mental and social game. While electronic games are
                becoming more stimulating in multiple senses; innovative or
                unpredictable game-play of people, joke or laughter with your
                fellow gamers are what mesmerize people to board games. Nowadays
                there are many themes, game mechanics and complexity in the
                designer board games catering to different people's tastes and
                to all ages â€“ children, family and adults. Hence, you can always
                find some board games you can enjoy.<br />
                <strong>What is so good about playing board games?</strong> As
                in any game be it sports or inter-human electronic games, player
                needs to understand the game rules, understand his/her fellow
                gamers' style or inclination, assess situations, weigh options
                and formulate strategies. Many of these are useful life skills
                that you can practice in the fun and safe environment of board
                games. If you lose, you can try again without losing an arm or a
                leg. Like sports, board game does promote bonding or camaraderie
                among the players if played in the right spirit. Additional
                element of board game is the heavy exercise of our mental
                strength, flexibility and endurance. Some of the game mechanics
                like negotiation are not even available in electronics game.
                Depending on the game title, you may learn about valuation cum
                investment, risk management, resource management, pattern
                recognition cum matching, negotiation, mind-reading, problem
                solving, decision making, creative thinking, strategic thinking,
                and so on.<br />
                <strong>Is it worth spending on board games?</strong> Board game
                can bring about interpersonal harmony and mental health, as
                explained in FAQ 1 and 2. Great board game can be played over
                and over again, yet having different game scenario every time
                and different tactics may need to be applied. Some games
                requiring deep or multi-pronged strategies can keep gamers
                engaged for years to master. With less than S$100, board game
                that brings about many benefits, playable in any place among
                peers and across generations, without running cost of battery or
                electricity, and without the risk of technology obsolescence, is
                definitely a worthwhile investment; not to mention great
                designer board games that can withstand the challenge of new
                games, and the test of time.
