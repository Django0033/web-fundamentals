                <p class="home-paragraph-1">
                    If you love stories dealing with the Cthulhu Mythos,
                    puzzles, mystery, and a good old fashioned dungeon crawling
                    experience, then look no further. Mansions of Madness 2nd
                    edition is the game that checkmarks all of those boxes.
                    Mansions of Madness 2nd edition is an app-assisted board
                    game for one to five players that takes two to three hours
                    to complete. This is a unique dungeon crawling,
                    horror-mystery experience that focuses on clue acquisition,
                    puzzle completion, and sometimes combat against the monsters
                    of the mythos.

                <h2 class="home-headline-2">Arkham Horror</h2>
                <p class="home-paragraph-2">
                    Released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2016, Arkham Horror: The
                    Card Game replaced the competitive Call of Cthulhu LCG with
                    a new, cooperative game. Instead of fighting each other,
                    players now team up to tackle the mysteries of Arkham over a
                    narrative campaign. Throughout their adventures, players
                    will be solving mysteries and leveling up their
                    investigators. Once again, this expandable card game follows
                    the Fantasy Flight Games LCG model, so players donâ€™t have to
                    hunt down rare cards in blind booster packs.

                <h2 class="home-headline-3">Shadow Over Normandie</h2>
                <p class="home-paragraph-3">
                    A few weeks after D-Day, a U.S. Ranger Company lost in
                    Normandie has to confront the terrifying power of the Nazis'
                    Cult of the Black Sun. Allied with an ancient Deep Ones
                    tribe, the Cult of the Black Sun is preparing a dark
                    ceremony to summon the great Cthulhu. T Shadows over
                    Normandie is a squad/platoon sized game based on the Heroes
                    System and is totally compatible with the Heroes of
                    Normandie board game. The game features three opposing
                    armies controlled by the players. These forces include the
                    German Cult of the Black Sun, the ancient Deep Ones, and the
                    U.S. Rangers. Each force is made up of infantry, tanks or
                    creatures and of course, heroes and villains. Each unit has
                    its own set of unique characteristics and skills depicted on
                    the high quality chunky tokens.
