            <h3>Color Palette</h3>
            <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

            <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
            <p>
                Palette URL:

                <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->

            <h3>Typography</h3>
            <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

            <h4>
                Heading Font: Arial (sans-serif)
                <!-- change this -->
            </h4>
            <p>
                I chose Arial sans-serif for hedings because it's the most used
                font.
                <!-- change this -->
            </p>

            <h4>
                Paragraph Font: Times New Roman (serif)
                <!-- change this -->
            </h4>
            <p>
                I chose Times New Roman serif for the paragraphs to make
                contrast with the Arial sans-serif of the headings.

            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->

                The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the
                pages in a site and how they are related and linked together.
                From the map above we can see that we will eventually have the
                Home page and 2 sub or child pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page
                should be accessible from any other page, it is essentially
                showing us the global navigation for the site.

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>
                Wireframes are like blueprints for making webpages. They should
                show the major sections of content that will be on the page and
                the relative locations of each element. In the wireframe below
                you can see there will be 6 sections to our page:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    At the top we have a section with the logo (the box with the
                    mountain means an image) and the navigation bar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then there is a banner image that stretches all the way
                    across the screen.
                </li>
                <li>Next we have some text and an image</li>
                <li>
                    ...followed by another row made up of an image and some
                    text.
                </li>
                <li>Then one more section of text with no image.</li>
                <li>
                    Lastly, a footer containing a copyright/name line and 3
                    social media icons.
                </li>
            </ol>
