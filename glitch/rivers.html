                            Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho

                        <p class="rivers-paragraph1">
                            Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No
                            Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given
                            the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by
                            the people living near it because of the number of
                            folks that came to visit and fell so in love with
                            the rugged beauty of the river that they never
                            left.<br />
                            Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around
                            the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also
                            commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined
                            with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over
                            the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide
                            shelter from sun or rain when needed.<br />
                            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class
                            I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed
                            rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river
                            the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early
                            summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late
                            summer. There are good rapids all summer...but
                            families with children who like to swim tend to
                            appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water
                            more.

                            Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah
                        </h2>
                        <p class="rivers-paragraph2">
                            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of
                            the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river
                            flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea.
                            High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery,
                            and great rapids have made this run famous. This
                            84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys
                            Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts
                            outstanding scenery, interesting geologic
                            formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic
                            human activity, and great whitewater
                            opportunities.<br />
                            Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually
                            done in 6 days.<br />
                            Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National
                            Landmark. This designation is based on the
                            uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                        <p class="rivers-paragraph3">
                            This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand
                            daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your
                            visit to the Grand Canyon.<br />
                            Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class
                            whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one
                            truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is
                            filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids,
                            but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins
                            accessible only by river.<br />
                            CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river
                            rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are
                            technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate
                            such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
                            However, most people are familiar with the regular I
                            - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
