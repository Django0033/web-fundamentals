# H1

Hello, my name is Eleazar but my friends call me Django and I'm working to get a bachelor's degree in Applied Technology.

I love to play video games and board games, I play the guitar and I'm a big rugby fan.

I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 18 years.
